1. It should be possible to couple all sensors with LEDs: those will be turned on when the sensor is active (thermal lamp is on, DHT is actively reading, etc.), blink for identification, and be turned off when not in use.
2. "CS" is placed in front of all class names to prevent name clashes.
3. It should probably be made possible to read state from output devices, too (check if LED is on, for example).

Classes:

BoardSimulator: a data source providing simulated data
BoardGpio: a data source providing real data

BoardManager: an interface between the board (or simulator) and the business logic. Simple API, easy to use. Contains a list of Devices

BoardTester: runs some tests of on BoardManager

Device:
 - input and output
 - LED, DHT, temperature, humidity, switch (thermal lamp, radiator)
 - read()
 - write()
 - identify()
 - control status LED

DataLogger:
 - saves to disk,
 - sends to network,
 - sends to DBUS

ClimateStationConfig: self-explanatory, isn't it?

ClimateStation: "main"
 - console API
 - GUI launcher
